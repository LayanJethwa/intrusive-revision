# Intrusive Revision

This is a multiple-choice flashcard app I have made for Android, with a simple design. It is intended for ease of use when you have a few minutes on your phone, and can be used offline.

The main feature of this project (though not yet implemented) will be the intrusive settings, where you can choose for it to popup on certain apps, for example social media, and give you a set number of questions to answer before letting you use the app.

It is targeted towards anyone who wants to integrate their learning into their daily life, and hopefully will be an effective tool!


## Installation

To install the app, simply head over to the releases tab, download the apk for the latest release, and open it on your Android device. A phone will work best (if the screen is wider than it is long, ie. a tablet, it may not work as intended).

The current release has been quickly hacked together to meet a deadline, so may be buggy.
